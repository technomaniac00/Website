    <p class="timeline"><br><br><strong>September 28th, 2000</strong><br> The Day I first cried on.</p>
    <p class="timeline">
      <strong>High School - Guru Tegh Bahadur Public school</strong><br>2014-2015<br>Mathematics, science, and social studies were some of the subjects under my high school curriculum. During my high school days, I participated in various school and state level olympiads and also achieved the 30th rank in an exam organized by 3rd Eye Center, which focused on science and mathematics. As part of my extra curricular activities, I was a member of the student council and the badminton team.  
    </p>
    <p class="timeline">
      <strong>Senior Secondary - Guru Tegh Bahadur Public school</strong><br>Major in Physics, Chemistry and
      Mathematics<br>2016-2017<br>Being erudite allowed me to secure a distinction in all of my major subjects. It also allowed me to take charge of various other responsibilities. Due to my arduous and effective tenure as Vice Head Boy, I was able to prove my worth and secure the post of Head Boy of the student council. Under my tenure as Head Boy, I led the student council organizing multiple profitable events. I was also awarded the title of Ambassador by the Road Safety Club for my social campaign to enforce the wearing of helmets and following traffic laws. The campaign was a success as the student participation in the Road Safety Club's helmet-wearing campaign increased by 50%, resulting in a decrease in traffic accidents in and around the campus.
    </p>
    <p class="timeline">
      <strong>Graduation - SRM Institute of Science and Technology</strong><br>Major in Computer Science Engineering<br>2017-2021<br>I have consistently performed well in my studies and graduated with distinction. This consistency allowed me to network with students from different parts of India. I have also learned various skills such as video editing, visual effects, graphic designing, photography, and videography. Due to my devotion and ability to bring ideas to life, I was given an opportunity to hold one of the most important positions, Convener at the Directorate of Student Affairs. I hosted numerous events including MILAN (a national-level cultural fest), club events, and events for social causes, and managed a team of 20 volunteers. I have also worked as Media Head at the CSE Association and Committee Head at AARUUSH (a national-level techno-management fest), and have been a part of various clubs such as OnePlus SRMIST and Project Casse. Through these experiences, I have developed excellent organizational and leadership skills, and the ability to work effectively in a team. I am excited to bring my skills and experiences to my future endeavors.
    </p>
    <p class="timeline">
      <strong>Systems Engineer - Tata Consultancy Services</strong><br>2021-present<br>In my current role, I am responsible for handling both the frontend and backend of client applications. This includes improving existing processes, adding new features, increasing the efficiency of currently used algorithms, and fixing bugs. I work with programming languages such as Perl, PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, and MySQL as the DB language, as well as Linux servers. As a result of my hard work and dedication, I have been honored with the "On The Spot Award" twice, the "Best team Award," and the "Learning Achievement Award." I take pride in achieving a defect density of 0, and my senior management and leadership at TCS have commended me on numerous occasions. Furthermore, I have been the top performer and received the highest rating during the last two consecutive cycles. I am constantly striving to improve my skills and knowledge to deliver even better results for my clients and company.

        Aditya and I worked together on a large-scale project for four years. Aditya's biggest strength is his ability to deal with conflicting priorities in high-pressure situations. He never loses his cool which is one of the reasons he stands out as an EA. It’s without hesitation that I recommend Aditya if you are looking for the best Media & Visual Expert.
